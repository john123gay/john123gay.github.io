	 <p>Web Developer Based out of the New York/New Jersey Metropolitan area</p>
	 <p>Since a young age I have been facinated with technology, I grew up watching
     the internet go from noisey, slow dial-up connection into what we have today. I remember windows 95
     being the biggest thing sliced bread, I remeber when a portable computer was a pipedream. needless to say
     that we have come a long way since then.
      </p>
	 <p>I have a love for coding and web development that was realized at an older age. In fact I used to hate
     the very idea of computer programming, but after giving it a second chance I fell in love. I began with
     learning java and python before becoming more focused on web development. </p>
	 <p>I have been making web pages and programming with javascript since 2016 and have added a myriad of
     tools for my toolbox along the way. Among those include jQuery, JSON, node.js, bootstrap, mysql, php, 
     the linux command line and the Github work flow. </p>
     <p>I also have a very basic knowledge of C and Electronics. I am a Raspbery Pi enthusiast and 
     have made a few projects with it including a weather station, a Kodi media player and a penetration tester.
     I plan on making many IoT projects with the Raspberry Pi in the future and will gladly showcase them as they are 
     released.
